## New Relic Terraform Provider v4: Major Release Details and More ðŸ“¢

A major release of the New Relic Terraform Provider, version **4.0.0**, took place on February 29, 2024 in order to discontinue support for the `MUTED` status utilized in resources used for managing Synthetic Monitors in the Terraform Provider. This decision was made in light of the end-of-life of the `MUTED` status of Synthetic Monitors on February 29, 2024.

The following is a comprehensive guide that lists the implications of this end-of-life, provides additional details, and offers alternatives to the `MUTED` status of Synthetic Monitors in the New Relic Terraform Provider.

### About Synthetic Monitors' 'MUTED' Status EOL and v4 of the New Relic Terraform Provider

#### New Relic Terraform Provider v4
As mentioned in the initial section of this guide, v4 of the New Relic Terraform Provider has been released to discontinue support for `MUTED` as a valid `status` value for Synthetic Monitors within the New Relic Terraform Provider.

It is important to note that all other features present in v3 of the New Relic Terraform Provider will continue to be supported in v4. Furthermore, all deprecated resources from the New Relic Terraform Provider v3 will remain as deprecated resources in v4 until they are eliminated through a subsequent major release of the New Relic Terraform Provider in the future.

For more detailed information regarding the end-of-life of the `MUTED` status of Synthetic Monitors, as well as the associated implications and alternatives, please refer to the subsequent sections of this guide.

#### EOL of Synthetic Monitors' 'MUTED' Status
On February 29, 2024, Synthetics discontinued support for the `MUTED` status, as a result of which `MUTED` is no longer a valid status value and any operations performed using the `MUTED` status in any version of the New Relic Terraform Provider will fail, since NerdGraph mutations/queries will no longer recognize `MUTED` as a valid status value of Synthetic Monitors.

You would be affected by this end-of-life only if your Terraform configuration continues to comprise `MUTED` as the value of the argument `status` post the end-of-life, in any of the following resources:

* [`newrelic_synthetics_monitor`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/synthetics_monitor)
* [`newrelic_synthetics_broken_links_monitor`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/synthetics_broken_links_monitor)
* [`newrelic_synthetics_cert_check_monitor`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/synthetics_cert_check_monitor)
* [`newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/synthetics_script_monitor)
* [`newrelic_synthetics_step_monitor`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/synthetics_step_monitor)

Hence, as stated in the initial section of this guide, starting with version **4.0.0** of the New Relic Terraform Provider, the `MUTED` status is no longer valid or functional for the `status` argument in all types of Synthetic Monitors, i.e. support for this value has been discontinued in the New Relic Terraform Provider too, starting with version 4.0.0. The following sections of this guide provide alternatives to replicate the behavior of the `MUTED` status for Synthetic Monitors.

-> **WARNING:** As communicated previously, all monitors with the status `MUTED` will have their status changed to `ENABLED` on the date of the end-of-life. Failure to update any existing monitors in your Terraform configuration with the `MUTED` status prior to the end-of-life will result in a drift being displayed when attempting to plan or apply the configuration containing monitors with the `MUTED` status. This is because Synthetics will change these monitors to `ENABLED`. If you encounter this situation, update all instances of `MUTED` in any monitors within your Terraform configuration to either `ENABLED` (to prevent drift) or `DISABLED` (if you wish to disable these monitors). Additionally, choose an appropriate alternative from the options described in the following section to enforce monitor muting through existing resources provided by the New Relic Terraform Provider.

### Alternatives To `MUTED` Status

There are two key alternatives one can opt for, to replicate the behavior of the `MUTED` status of Synthetic Monitors.
* [**Alert Muting Rules**](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/muting-rules-suppress-notifications/)
  * Alert Muting Rules, by definition, are similar to the `MUTED` status of Synthetic Monitors in terms of behavior, though these cater to a wider scope; all kinds of alerts. These help mute alerts on the basis of pre-defined schedules and attribute matching (when alerts match the condition(s) prescribed by the user in terms of incident event attributes, operators and values, they can be muted). See [this page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/understand-technical-concepts/incident-event-attributes/) for a comprehensive list of attributes supported by Muting Rules.
  * This feature may be availed from the New Relic One UI, NerdGraph, and also via the resource [`newrelic_alert_muting_rule`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/alert_muting_rule) in the New Relic Terraform Provider. Check out the example below to find how this resource can _exactly_ be used to substitute the `MUTED` status of a Synthetic Monitor.
* [**Monitor Downtime**](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-downtimes-disable-monitoring-during-scheduled-maintenance-times/)
  * A 'Monitor Downtime', as the name suggests, helps set up a 'downtime' or a maintenance window for Synthetic Monitors, in which period they do not run, as a result of which alerts are not raised, and no notifications are received.
  * This feature may be availed from the New Relic One UI, NerdGraph and also via a _new_ resource that's been built to facilitate managing Monitor Downtimes via Terraform, [`newrelic_monitor_downtime`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/monitor_downtime). Check out the example below for an understanding of how this resource helps mute monitors.

It is important to note the difference between the functioning of Alert Muting Rules and Monitor Downtimes when these are considered to be used as substitutes to the `MUTED` status of Synthetic Monitors.
* Since Alert Muting Rules are designed to mute alerts based on conditions they match, alerts generated by checks performed by monitors are muted; however, this does not affect the checks performed by these monitors, which would continue to function as usual.
* Since Monitor Downtimes are dedicated to scheduling "downtime"s of monitors, no alerts would be generated by monitors in this case, as they would stop running checks for the period defined in the downtime.
  Users may need to choose the right alternative, based on the expected behavior they desire, when monitors are muted.

### Substituting Synthetic Monitors `MUTED` Status With Alert Muting Rules

The simplest method to mute a Synthetic Monitor via the [`newrelic_alert_muting_rule`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/alert_muting_rule) resource is to use the GUID of the Synthetic Monitor in the condition used to define the muting rule, and match it against the `entity.guid` attribute in the condition. The following code snippet gives an example of the same.

```hcl
resource "newrelic_synthetics_monitor" "sample_synthetics_monitor" {
  status           = "ENABLED"
  name             = "Sample Monitor"
  period           = "EVERY_MINUTE"
  uri              = "https://www.one.newrelic.com"
  type             = "BROWSER"
  locations_public = ["AP_EAST_1"]
  custom_header {
    name  = "some_name"
    value = "some_value"
  }
  enable_screenshot_on_failure_and_script = true
  validation_string                       = "success"
  verify_ssl                              = true
  tag {
    key    = "some_key"
    values = ["some_value"]
  }
}
resource "newrelic_alert_muting_rule" "sample_alert_muting_rule" {
  name        = "Sample Muting Rule"
  enabled     = true
  description = "A muting rule, deployed to test a muting rule with a monitor."
  condition {
    conditions {
      attribute = "entity.guid"
      operator  = "EQUALS"
      values    = [newrelic_synthetics_monitor.sample_synthetics_monitor.id]
    }
    operator = "AND"
  }
  schedule {
    start_time = "2023-10-31T06:30:00"
    end_time   = "2023-11-01T16:30:00"
    time_zone  = "America/Los_Angeles"
  }
}
```

The configuration of the muting rule may be customized, based on any apt approach identified - one of which could be to use the attribute `conditionId` in the condition, to match it against the ID of the alert condition that checks for failures of tests run by the preferred Synthetic Monitor (for instance, a `SyntheticCheck` based NRQL Alert Condition), so the muting rule is applied to any alerts originating out of the condition that evaluates monitor failures/successes. Head over to the [documentation of the resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/alert_muting_rule) for more details on attributes supported by `condition` blocks.

### Substituting Synthetic Monitors `MUTED` Status With a Monitor Downtime

Setting up a Monitor Downtime resource with GUIDs of the right monitors would disable Synthetic checks in the window specified, thereby, muting the monitor (please read the differences between Muting Rules and Monitor Downtimes, explained above).

```hcl
resource "newrelic_monitor_downtime" "foo" {
  name = "Sample Monitor Downtime"
  monitor_guids = [
    "<GUID-1>",
    "<GUID-2>"
  ]
  mode       = "WEEKLY"
  start_time = "2023-11-30T10:30:00"
  end_time   = "2023-12-10T10:30:00"
  time_zone  = "Asia/Kolkata"
  end_repeat {
    on_date = "2023-12-20"
  }
  maintenance_days = [
    "MONDAY",
    "TUESDAY",
  ]
}
```
